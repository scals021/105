# 105 ðŸŽ¾
Don't let the fast paced math stand in the way of playing the world's best tennis game 105.  

### How do you play 
- Before startng you need at least 4 or more players, a coach, and a basket of balls.  
- Teams are divided on each side of the net
- The instructor feeds balls from the side of the net and the teams play out the point.
- The doubles team that win the point stay in for the next point. (Note:  Faster feeds are strongly preferred)
- Whichever team reaches 105 first is crowned the winner 

### Scoring 
1 point for just winning the point
5 points for winning the point off of a groundstroke winner
10 points for winning the point off of a volley winner
20 points for winning the point off of an overhead winner


### How was this built? - React Native in Expo! 

You can run the React Native app with [this Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@satya164/github.com-callstack-react-native-paper:example). Snack allows you to make changes to the example app directly in the online editor and see changes on your phone instantly using the [Expo](https://expo.io/) app without having to install or setup anything on your computer. You can also "Export" it to download as a standalone Expo app to run locally.

If you want to run the example from the repo,

- Clone the repository and run `yarn bootstrap` in the root
- Run `yarn example start` to start the packager
- Follow the instructions to open it with the [Expo app](https://expo.io/)

### Web App

You can also run the example app as a web app using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web),

- Clone the repository and run `yarn bootstrap` in the root
- Run `yarn example web` to start the webpack server and open the app in your browser
